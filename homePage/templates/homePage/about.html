                I love to make an impact and help to innovate.
            </p>

            <p class="textOne">
                I’m a computer science student at Oregon State University with a passion for artificial intelligence, user interface design, and full-stack development. I enjoy building tools and applications that combine thoughtful design with practical functionality, especially projects that solve real-world problems. 
                Whether it’s a web app, a mobile solution, or an AI-driven system, I love taking an idea from concept to completion.
            </p>

            <p class="textTwo">
                Outside of coding, I’m fascinated by emerging technology trends and enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and languages. 
                I thrive in collaborative environments and value learning from others, while also pushing myself to continuously improve my skills. 
                When I’m not at my computer, you can usually find me exploring the outdoors, weightlifting, or tinkering with personal tech projects.
